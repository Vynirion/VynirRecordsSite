         <h1> About VynirRecords </h1>
         <h2> The beginning and the future for where Vynir will go.  </h2>
         <p>I started out using MIDI instruments and phone applications to produce my music. Always having a sense of hearing for different compositions in the musical world. Ending up spending much of my free time 
            making small tracks, snippets, drum-loops, and more. Eventually, I started combining everything I taught myself with, and begun creating music and my brand, VynirRecords.
            I have always loved listening to a wide range of music, from many different genres and sub-genres. However, in my late years of middle school, the genre of Electronic Dance Music,
            caught my senses-- since then I have exclusivly listened to that genre of music. Learning all about the different sub-genres that make up the world in which my brand resides. 
            Eventually, I picked up a phone application in the early stages of 2015, this app is known as Drum Pads 24, a mobile LaunchPad MIDI device, yet in a portable IOS app form. 
            By using this app, I created many different tracks, ideas, my own musical packs and so on, and in the end of the year 2020, I made songs that I was proud of-- and thus the brand of 
            VynirRecords was created.         
        </p>

        <h2> The many different tools I have used to get to where I am. </h2>
            <p2> Making music is sometimes a chore, an everlasting idea that continues for days on end until that one note finally lands in its place. At times, I will spend weeks on one
                single beat until I land on something that just sounds right. In no way, am I a fully fledge artist, nor am I just a nobody; however, with the use of many tools at my disposal
                getting to where I wish VynirRecords to go will be smooth sailing. 

                In the past and present, Drum Pads 24, has been a very usefull resource to me. The times this app is opened on a daily basis is around twenty-five to thirty times. Any chance
                a quick beat or idea comes to mind, it is recorded and played. This is where the majority of all the tracks are produced, the idea and functionality of live-recording/performing
                a track is much more rewarding to me, than spending months on one single track through a software. All my tracks have taken time to create, with many itterations being 
                created over the days of constructing that perfect piece. Further into this page, down below, you can find the tools I have personally used to help build where I am today.

         <h4>Where I am now, and where I wish to go</h4>
         <p4> VynirRecords was orginally made to get my music out there, to see if others might enjoy the same style I enjoyed. To my surprise, people starting liking and viewing my content 
             on my soundcloud. A song I created that I thought was absolutley terrible, ended up being my most listened to track, with ~3000 plays. To me, thats a giant number. This in itself
             inspired me to continue my path, and put my music on other platforms: Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Google Play etc. I still upload to this day, and slowly gaining progress towards my goal.
             By the end of each year, I wish to amass, 500 concurrent listeners across the majority of my platforms, more favorably, Spotify.
